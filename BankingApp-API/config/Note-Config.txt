npm install config

# The config module is used read properties depending upon the running environment.

# For no environment specified --> default.json is read and returns the required value
# For development environment --> development.json is read and returns the required value
# For production environment --> production.json is read and returns the required value

# The custom-environment-variables.json file maps the environment variables and returns the value set in environment.

*** In this application I'm using custom-environment-variables.json file to supply the JWT secret key when required from environment variable.
Note: The application will not start if the 'bankingapp-secretkey' is not set in environment variable.
